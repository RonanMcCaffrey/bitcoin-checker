# BitcoinChecker

This project is a simple webapp to display realtime bitcoin transactions,  using Angular, Websockets, and the Tabulator.

# How To Run
To run this app, simply do a git clone on the code, or download the zip file, unzip it to a folder location, open the command line at that location and type:
npm install

then once all the required packages are installed type:
ng serve -o

A local browser window should appear and after a few seconds, bitcoin transactions should start to appear.

# Further Improvements
Use services to handle all the Websocket implementation details
Use Charting libraries to visualise data
Add menu options to choose which currency to follow, currently set to Euro.
