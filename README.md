# BitcoinChecker

This project is a simple webapp to display realtime bitcoin transactions,  using Angular, Websockets, and the Tabulator.

# Further Improvements
Use services to handle all the Websocket implementation details
Use Charting libraries to visualise data
Add menu options to choose which currency to follow, currently set to Euro.
